This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in COBOL related to the implicit handling of decimal points in numeric fields. Some COBOL compilers might allow implicit decimal points while others don't.  This inconsistency can lead to different program behavior across different environments and makes debugging difficult. The bug.cob file contains code that exhibits this issue. The bugSolution.cob file offers a solution to ensure consistent behavior regardless of the compiler used.
